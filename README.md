# PolyQuest
A 2D-3D platformer and a work in progress

Some previous versions:

Easier level: https://pbreslinuo.github.io/PolyQuest_PoC/
Harder level: https://pbreslinuo.github.io/PolyQuest_HarderLvl/

A, D, Space to move, R to reset the level.
The jumping system is hard on purpose.
Nothing happens when you “win” yet, but the point is to get to the exit in the right orientation.
