# PolyQuest
A 2D-3D platformer and a work in progress

To download, either download all of the files or download the unity package and import it into a new unity project.

Some previous versions:

Alpha Build: https://pbreslinuo.github.io/PolyQuest_Alpha_Playtest/

Easier level: https://pbreslinuo.github.io/PolyQuest_PoC/

Harder level: https://pbreslinuo.github.io/PolyQuest_HarderLvl/

A, D, Space to move, R to reset the level.
The jumping system is hard on purpose.
Nothing happens when you “win” yet, but the point is to get to the exit in the right orientation.
